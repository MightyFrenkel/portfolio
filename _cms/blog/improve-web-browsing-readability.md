Are you tired of constantly adjusting to different website designs every time you browse the web?
You’re not alone! While most websites strive to provide a great user experience, the emphasis on unique aesthetics often leads to readability challenges for users.
This is a problem I encounter myself, it is difficult for me to read text when the contrast is to high.

While navigation in user experience (UX) has largely been standardized with features like top navbars and hamburger menus, the inconsistency in font sizes, styles, and colors across websites can be frustrating.
It can make reading content a struggle, forcing users to adapt to each site’s design rather than the site adapting to their preferences.

## Build in browser settings

But fear not, there are solutions to make browsing the web a more seamless experience tailored to your needs.
One option is to take advantage of your browser’s built-in font and color settings.
By tweaking these settings in browsers like Chrome and Firefox, you can customize the appearance of text and colors to suit your preferences.
This is surprisenly easy to do in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-fonts-and-colors-websites-use)

## Dark Reader extension

Alternatively, a more effective solution that many users swear by is using browser extensions like Dark Reader.
Dark Reader transforms website colors to dark mode, making the text more readable and reducing eye strain, especially in low light environments.
This extension works by dynamically adjusting the color scheme of websites, creating a consistent and comfortable reading experience across different sites.
You can use this extension to change a website to any theme that you want.
For example, you can also use [Dark Reader with Catputcin](https://github.com/catppuccin/dark-reader)
